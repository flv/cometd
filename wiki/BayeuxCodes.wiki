List of error codes is below:

 
|| *code* || *constant* || *message* || *explanation* ||
||300||RC_VERSION_MISMATCH||Version number mismatch.||Status code 300, version mismatch, is used when an incoming handshake request contains a version the server does not support.  The server should respond with version and minimum version values in failed handshake response.  The client should rehandshake only if it can support a version advertised by the server.  The advice field indicates if client should retry the handshake.  The error code provides additional information on why handshake failed.|| 
||301||RC_CONNTYPE_MISMATCH||Connection type mismatch.||Status code 301, connection type mismatch, is used when an incoming handshake request's supportedConnectionTypes field does not match a supported connection type on the server.  The server should respond with list of supportedConnectionTypes in the response.  The client should re-handshake only if it provides a supportedConnectionType advertised by the server.The advice field indicates if client should retry the handshake.  The error code provides additional information on why handshake failed.|| 
||302||RC_EXT_MISMATCH||Extension mismatch.||Status code 302, extension mismatch, is used when an incoming handshake request's  extension field does not match a supported extension on the server.  The server should respond with list of supported extensions in the response.  The client should re-handshake only if it provides a valid (or no) extension field advertised by the server.  The advice field indicates if client should retry the handshake.  The error code provides additional information on why handshake failed.|| 
||400||RC_BAD_REQUEST||The incoming request could not be recognized by the server.|| Status code 400, bad request, is used when an incoming request is not recognized by the server.   A typical case would be when the request contains invalid JSON.||
